# Movie finder app

With this final project we have a goal to build an application (web page) which will give a user possibility to search for a movie in a huge database of IMDb.

There are no limits for a design of the application. You can take a look on existing solutions and then try to build a copy of it or try to come up with something new!

## Requriments
Following features should be present in the app:
- search movie via name (full name of part of a name if possible)
- present search results in a list (if there are more then one was found)
- present different types of movie data - picture, description, rating, year and so on.

### Technical details
Following api could be used for free:
- http://www.omdbapi.com/
- https://developer.fandango.com/rotten_tomatoes - for that you'll need to write an application form

UI framework:
- https://getbootstrap.com/

Of course you have complete freedom to choose other providers.

### What we're practising here
- app design and layout
- UI framework usage (for ex. bootstrap)
- API calls
- work with users interactions (input)
- data presentation
- state changes (cleaning ui after new search, display loader during a search request and so on)
- error handling
