# Weather app

With this final project we have a goal to build an application (web page) which will present basic weather parameters.

There are no limits for a design of the application. You can take a look on existing solutions and then try to build a copy of it or try to come up with something new. You never know, maybe it would be the next best weather app :-)

## Requriments
Following features should be present in the app:
- search current weather via city name
- present current weather and forecast to the user for a given city
- use different icons to display different types of weather. Ex.: cloudy, sunny, rain and so on.
- if possible display a picture of a city

### Technical details
There are different providers with possibilities to use api to some extend for free:
- https://openweathermap.org/api
- https://developer.accuweather.com/apis

Animated icons:
- https://www.amcharts.com/free-animated-svg-weather-icons/

UI framework:
- https://getbootstrap.com/

Of course you have complete freedom to choose other providers.

### What we're practising here
- app design and layout
- UI framework usage (for ex. bootstrap)
- API calls
- work with users interactions (input)
- data presentation
- state changes (cleaning ui after new city search, display loader during a search request and so on)
- error handling
