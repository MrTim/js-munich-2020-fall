# Stock price check app

With this final project we have a goal to build an application (web page) which will present give a user possiblity to search for a stock prices.

There are no limits for a design of the application. You can take a look on existing solutions and then try to build a copy of it or try to come up with something new!

## Requriments

Following features should be present in the app:

- search exact stock price via code. Ex.: ZM, APPL and so on
- present price after it was found or display an error message
- search possible stocks via names.
  Ex: user entered "apple" then the output should be a list of stocks which available for this search query
- if possible, create and display some historical data
