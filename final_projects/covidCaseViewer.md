# Covid case viewer

With this final project we have a goal to build an application (web page) which will represent a different types of data related to Covid 19 cases. Overall worldwide or locally by country or city.

There are no limits for a design of the application. You can take a look on existing solutions and then try to build a copy of it or try to come up with something new!

## Requriments
Following features should be present in the app:
- by default display cases for eather predefined county or globally
- search data for county or city via name
- present search results

### Technical details
Following api could be used for free:
- https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc - data from Johns Hopkins CSSE

UI framework:
- https://getbootstrap.com/

Of course you have complete freedom to choose other providers.

### What we're practising here
- app design and layout
- UI framework usage (for ex. bootstrap)
- API calls
- work with users interactions (input)
- data presentation
- state changes (cleaning ui after new search, display loader during a search request and so on)
- error handling
