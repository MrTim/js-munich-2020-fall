# Tic-tac-toe game

This is a classic game and we will try to build it with help of JS. (please follow [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) for a detailed description of the game itself).

## Requriments
Following features should be present in the app:
- user should be able to make a turn - eather with mouse or by entering where to put a mark
- <b>O</b> or <b>X</b> should be randomly given to a user before game starts
- "other player" will be a "browser". That means that there should be a program which will make the turns agains the user
- if possible: display the amount of games was played and score. And in that case it should be possible for the uer to start over again

### Technical details
Here won't be any API calls.

UI framework:
- https://getbootstrap.com/

Of course you have complete freedom to choose other providers.

### What we're practising here
- app design and layout
- UI framework usage (for ex. bootstrap)
- work with users interactions (input/clicks)
- state changes (cleaning ui before new game started)
- error handling
